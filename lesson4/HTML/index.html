            Among design professionals, there's a bit of controversy surrounding
            the filler text. Controversy, as in Death to Lorem Ipsum. The
            strength of lorem ipsum is its weakness: it doesn't communicate. To
            some, designing a website around placeholder text is unacceptable,
            akin to sewing a custom suit without taking measurements. Kristina
            Halvorson notes: “I’ve heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is
            effective in wireframing or design because it helps people focus on
            the actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here
            is that we’re talking about creating a user experience that will
            (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure
            of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.”
